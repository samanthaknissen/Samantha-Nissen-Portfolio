  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    During the day I work as a publicity and program coordinator at the University of Iowa's International Writing Program. From design and writing to project management and public relations, I spend my time connecting with organizations and people from around the globe. In my free time, I enjoy designing and building websites, binge watching TV shows, and travelling.
